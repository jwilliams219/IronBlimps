# Question 7

## Table of avg cost/time for 10 iterations

Algorithm | Average Path Cost | Average Time to Run
---|---|---
A* (our implementation) | 101 nodes | 0.0497 seconds
A* (from AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics) | 85 nodes | 0.746 seconds
BFS | 85 nodes | 0.623 seconds
Bidirectional A* | 86 nodes | 0.702 seconds
Dijkstra | 100 nodes | 0.589 seconds
RRT* | 140.3 nodes | 4.784641242027282 seconds


- The A* (not ours), BFS and Bidirectional A* provided the lowest cost path on average.
- The fastest algorithm was our implementation of A* which ran at an average of 0.05 seconds to converge.
- I would change our planner so that it would find slightly shorter paths. One of the ways we could do this is by modifying our cost function, or not having the algorithm finish as soon as it converges, but rather look for better paths.
- The "best" planner seems to be A* or Bidirectional A* since they find very good paths in a short-ish time. But it really depends on your use case. If quick paths are needed I'd use our implementation of A* even though it is slightly less efficient.
