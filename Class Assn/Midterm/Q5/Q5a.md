Three merits and three demerits of using reinforcement learning for mechatronic systems.

Pros:
1. Good to solve complex problems with no known optimal solution.
2. Good when the only way to collect information about the environmment is interacting with it.
3. Can learn to adapt a skill to a unseen but similar task. It could even adapt to harware changes like wear or changing parts.

Cons:
1. Need a lot of data and computation which may be limited. High dimentionality may make models inefficient.
2. Wear and tear may be expensive when collecting training data.
3. Won't have direct control over the actions of the system, it could perform unexpected actions.
