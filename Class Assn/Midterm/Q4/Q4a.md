There are two equations that are the secret of the cart and pole problem.

The first one is angular acceleration - which depends on gravity, the force exerted, the current angle, the current angular velocity, and the mass of the cart and mass and length of the pole.

The second one is x acceleration - which depends on the same things except gravity.

As the pole falls further away from the center or its angular velocity increases, it requires a greater force in order to counter-act the falling. Also, if gravity is higher, or the mass of the pole or cart or length of the pole is larger, then a larger force will be required as well.
